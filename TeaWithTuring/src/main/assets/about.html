<h3>Introduction from the editor</h3>

<p>Take Tea With Turing follows the principle that the only way to really get to know someone is to sit down and have a cup of tea with them. Since Alan Mathison Turing died in 1954, the next best thing is to take some time to consider the many and varied ways in which the impact of his work and principles continue to influence contemporary society. This anthology brings together short pieces of creative work -- poetry, fiction, script, music and animation -- by people who have found inspiration in the story of Turing's life and work.</p>
<p>The stories we tell about other people reveal our own fascinations and secrets. In compiling this anthology I feel I've seen a valuable snapshot of the world a hundred years after Turing's birth, still looking for explanations about the world around us and about who that world allows us to be.</p>
<p>I've spent part of my residency researching a novel -- about a cleaner who makes friends with a robot -- inspired by the architecture of the Informatics Forum and the conversations I've been having with researchers about the meanings and values of human and artificial life. Outside of the residency it felt as though everyone I spoke to about my novel knew someone also writing about Turing. I wanted to reach out and find out more; what were they writing, what pulled them into the subject, what aspect of Turing's life were they unwrapping.</p>
<p>Informatics is the science of information -- how natural and artificial systems process, store and communicate information. In designing this anthology as an app I wanted to play with traditional ideas of literary communication. The anthology is divided into sections using the three markers, and the pieces are loaded on random shuffle so you never know what is coming next. My hope is that you will enjoy Take Tea With Turing as a conversation, never entirely certain what the other person will say...</p>
